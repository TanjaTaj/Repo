    <h2>UI: Website for Småtrollens föräldrakooperativ</h2>
    <p id="para1">For this project I worked in a team of four, and I was also the Scrum master. The duration of the project was one sprint consisting of two weeks. </p>

        <h4>Our mission</h4>
      <p>To design a new website for Småtrollens föräldrakooperativ, a daycare in Gothenburg where the parents are highly involved, and nature is the classroom.</p>

        <h4>How did we do it:</h4>
        <p>We met with the client who told us about themselves, their core values, and a general idea of what they wanted included in their new website. They gave some stylistic suggestions, but let us know that we had complete creative freedom. These are some of the things we kept in mind while designing: the client does not like the current design of the website. They find it to be outdated and not aesthetic. They want more photos and a new colour scheme. What is most important is that the website is simple and will be easy for them to maintain. </p>

        <h4>Heuristic evaluation:</h4>
        <p>In order to determine what we needed to change from the original design, we did a heuristic evaluation using two of Nielsens ten heuristics: “Aesthetic and Minimalistic design” and “Recognition rather than recall”. These heuristics are general principles for interaction design. 
        The insights: we needed to decrease the amount of text and divide the text so it is easier for users to read. The menu is unclear and confusing, and so are the different categories. The colours of the website do not reflect the client, and the design is outdated. </p>

        <h4>Brainstorm:</h4>
        <p>
          To determine a layout we used the “Crazy 8” method, which is a workshop where you sketch eight different solutions, to quickly generate ideas. We voted on our favourite designs for each page of the website. 
          We used card sorting to decide the structure of the content.
          We gathered all the text content that the client wanted included, and sorted it into these categories: Landing page, Pedagogy, Our parent cooperative, and Contact.

        <h4>UI:</h4>
        <p>
          Having a rough idea of the layout, it was time to start designing the UI. To work more efficiently we split up the work among the team, while still keeping a good level of communication. 
          I started by creating recurring components such as buttons and the interest forms, and I used a Bootstrap UI kit as a base to build off of. Since Bootstrap is a standard used by many developers, it will save time later in the development process. 
          The client wanted a simple, minimalistic design that would be easy for them to maintain and update. They also wanted more photos and less text than their existing website.

        <h4>Colours:</h4>
        <p>
          The client gave suggestions for a colour scheme consisting of muted green, brown and blue, and a logo with pinecones. They motivated this as representing nature, which they work a lot with. For this reason we decided to keep these, adding a cream white for the background and the button text, and a dark grey for the text content. We chose these over black and white since it gives a softer impression, which we felt represented the client's warmth and welcoming energy.

        <h4>Takeaways:</h4>
        <p>
          To design a new website for a real client was a great learning experience for me, since it was great training for the future. 
          I got to use what I've learned about colour theory and typography to create a website that is easy to use and interact with, that also reflects the client. E.g. how people associate green with nature and blue with reliability. We used sans serif fonts because those are easiest for people to read on a screen. 
          We used deadlines within the project, e.g. when the mid-fidelity design needed to be done. This was helpful since it ensured that the work progressed quickly and efficiently. It is something I will continue with in future projects.
